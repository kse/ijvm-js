## Known Issues

The program is in a rough state right now, since it is still a work in
progress, thus there are several know limitations. Specifically, be aware of
the following.

- Currently the *ijvm.spec* file is hardcoded and the parser does not support
	alternative usage. This means you cannot add new IJVM commands.
- The visualization is very rough and the microinstructions themselves aren't
	shown. This needs fixing.
- There is no indication as to which IJVM instruction the program is executing.
- The two editors probably need to be shown at the same time, so it is easier
	to follow the flow of the program.
- Passing parameters is awful, they are simply space separated.
- There is no feedback on parsing errors, excepting in the console.
- The stack is not really shown. In fact, a major problem with showing the
	stack is that it is not always in the ideal state. So TOS may never be
	written before SP is decremented below it. A more ideal thing would be to
	create an idealized stack layout when changing IJVM command, while also
	showing the *real* stack layout (including pointers).
- The result of the computation is only shown in the console.
